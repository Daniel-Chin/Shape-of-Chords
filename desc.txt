There are many interesting visualization methods for pitches and chords. For example, you can put sand on a vibrating plate and patterns will form; you can shine a laser on a vibrating balloon and the reflection will draw cool shapes on a wall. These methods, however, are not mathematically unique. If you do the experiment with different equipment you will get different results. My approach, however, is free of arbitrary parameters. I want to show the one true shape of chords.
